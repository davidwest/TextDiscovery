<h4><strong>Mission, Goals, Motivations, Vision, and Values:</strong></h4>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;"><strong>ITS Mission</strong>:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;">Information Technology Services provides technology infrastructure and services that advance teaching and learning, enable research, enrich the student IT experience, and effectively manage institutional information, in support of LSU’s pursuit of national prominence as Louisiana’s Flagship University.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;"><strong>ITS Flagship Goals:</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">1. To provide excellent and highly valued IT infrastructure and services that enable LSU to fulfill its broad missions in teaching and learning, research, student life, outreach and community service, and economic development and the promotion of life-long learning in the State of Louisiana.<br>
<br>
2. To be a recognized leader, nationally, in the creative use, application, and provision of information technology so as to best position LSU to be a leader, nationally, among public universities.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;"><strong>ITS Motivations:</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;">Information technology is certainly one of the most critical, enabling tools in higher education today, and the great universities of the future will be those that have an exemplary IT infrastructure and embrace IT services; we want LSU to be a great University. We set out to transform LSU from a university simply tolerating technology to one that truly embraces it to advance teaching and learning, enable research, enrich the student life experience, and effectively and productively manage the university as an academic enterprise.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;"><strong>ITS Vision:</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 20px;">Within prudent and reasonable resources, and in line with institutional priorities, ITS will provide an environment that features “IT Abundance” … wherein IT is advanced, current, and readily available to support faculty, staff, and students in their achievement of the mission of the institution. ITS will be excellent in providing for IT Abundance in infrastructure and services, not as its own end, but as a way in which the mission of the institution is ultimately served.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;"><strong>ITS Values:</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">• We value our most prized resource – the people of ITS who pursue excellence and deliver it in terms of IT infrastructure and services.<br>
• We value our relationships with the faculty, students, and staff of LSU – our customers, partners, colleagues, and friends – and thus honor a service culture above all else.<br>
• We value the trust placed in us by university administration, the Board of Supervisors, and the Board of Regents, to be efficient and effective in the use of all resources.<br>
• We value the security of the technology resources and information entrusted to our care, and will be vigilant in maintaining the integrity of these critical items.<br>
